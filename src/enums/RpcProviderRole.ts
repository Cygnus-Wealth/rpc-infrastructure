/**
 * Priority role of an RPC endpoint within a chain's fallback chain.
 *
 * Defines the priority ordering for endpoint selection during RPC calls.
 * The fallback chain progresses through roles in order: primary → secondary
 * → tertiary → emergency when higher-priority endpoints fail or are unavailable.
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * import { RpcProviderRole } from '@cygnus-wealth/rpc-infrastructure';
 *
 * const endpoint = {
 *   role: RpcProviderRole.PRIMARY,
 *   url: 'https://eth-mainnet.alchemyapi.io/v2/...'
 * };
 * ```
 *
 * @since 1.0.0
 * @stability extended
 *
 * @see {@link RpcEndpointConfig} for endpoint configuration
 * @see {@link ChainRpcConfig} for chain-level fallback ordering
